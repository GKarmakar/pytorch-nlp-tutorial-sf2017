Environment Setup
=================

On this page, you will find not only the list of dependencies to install
for the tutorial, but a description of how to install them.

0. Get Anaconda
---------------

Anaconda is a Python (and R) distribution that aims to provide everything
needed for common scientific and machine learning situations out-of-the-box.

In practice, Anaconda can used to manage different environment and packages.
Our core instructions will assume that you have anaconda installed as your default
Python distribution.  When needed, we will include alternate instructions in case
you do not use Anaconda (though, you probably should).

You can download Anaconda here: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

After installing anaconda, you can access its command-line interface
with the :code:`conda` command.


1. Create a new environment
---------------------------

Environments are a tool for sanitary software development.  By this, we mean that
you can install specific versions of packages without worrying that it breaks
a dependency elsewhere.

Here is how you can create an environment with anaconda

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -n dl4nlp python=3.6


2. Install Dependencies
-----------------------

2a. Activate the environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After creating the environment, you need to **activate** the environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   source activate dl4nlp

After an environment is activated, it might prepend/append itself to your
console prompt to let you know it is active.

With the environment activated, any installation commands
(whether it is :code:`pip install X`, :code:`python setup.py install` or using
Anaconda's install command :code:`conda install X`) will only install inside
the environment.

2b. Install ipython and jupyter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We include a :code:`requirements.txt` for the core of the dependencies, but
there are some basic dependencies not included in it:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install ipython
   conda install jupyter

To allow a jupyter notebooks to use this environment as their kernel, it
needs to be linked:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m ipykernel install --user --name dl4nlp


2c. Install PyTorch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are instructions on http://pytorch.org which detail how to install it.
If you have been following along so far and have anaconda installed, you can simply do:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install pytorch torchvision cuda80 -c soumith

2d. Install Dependencies from Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming the you have cloned the repository, please navigate to the directory
in your terminal.  Then, you can do the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt
