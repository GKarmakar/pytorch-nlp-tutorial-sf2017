Getting the Data
================

In this training, there are two options of participating.
The first option is to download the data below, setup the environment, and download the notebooks when we make them available.
If you choose this options but do not download the data before the first day, we will have several flash drives the data on it.

The second option is to use an online resource provided by O'Reilly. On the first day of this training, you will be provided with a link to a JupyterHub instance where the environment will be pre-made and ready to go!
